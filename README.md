# GodotCarrier2D
My first attempts at making something with godot

The core idea is a 2d strategic carrier command game. Direct your carrier (and escorts?) through battle areas, 
launching and managing fighters and bombers on missions against hostile targets.

Presentation will be simple polygonal graphics drawing inspiration from stylised digital naval radar and tactical awareness displays; dark background with light icons, 
lines and glyphs marking information 

Core gameplay would be RTS, giving your ships and squadronds movement and attack orders around static, bounded battle fields.
A big part of the gameplay would be balancing the macro positioning of you slow fleet with the rapid response afforded by your flight wings,
and ensuring that you prepare your reserves with the right equipment to counter the threats you will face in that mission.

Planes will have fuel limiting the duration of their missions and it will take time for a landed plane to be requipped and refueled to join the reservers.
Furthermore there may be constraints on carrier operations, eg unable to land planes whilst manoeuvring and unable to land and launch planes at the same time.
This makes it important to consider when and what you should launch, and may force hard decisions between recovering planes and taking more critical losses.

I'd like to make a short campaign of a sequence of missions, each with a different challenge (assault fortified islands, 
ambush a fleet at harbour, interception on the high seas, dual with hostile carriers, pitched battle with allied fleet, etc).

Would like to have an upgrade mechanic with the carrier being highly modular and able to have systems and equipment replaced for each mission.

Naturally my imagination is bigger than my focus and capbilities here, so this readme should be fully considered aspirational.
